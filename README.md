# PatternBreaker
This is a match game where you rotate a dial to match the symbol on the dial with the symbol on the screen

This is a game I made for Unity a while ago to attempt and create a pattern matching game.

You can add more symbols to the dial and more symbols to the pattern to match before the dial symbols are reset.
